## Description

This application uses mysql to view and manage departments, roles, and employees in a company database. By using inquirer prompts and prepared statements, the user doesn't need to write SQL scripts to perform various actions. I learned a new way of using inquirer in conjunction with a database. I also learned how to handle data using mysql.

## Usage
You will need MySQL and Node.js to run this application. You will need to install inquirer v8.2.4 and mysql2. From the db folder open a terminal and enter `mysql -uroot`. Next, enter `source schema.sql` followed by `source seeds.sql`. This will load the database and tables. Finally, from the server.js file, open a terminal and enter `node server.js` to begin the application. You can scroll through the options and select an action.
